**Zo'raki folbin** 

Bir bor ekan, bir yo’q ekan, qadim zamonda bir chol bilan kampir bo’lgan ekan. Ular kambag’allik bilan kun ko’rar ekanlar. Bir kuni kampir shahar hammomiga boribdi. Hali boshiga chaplagan qatig’ini yuvib ulgurmay, hammomga xodimlardan biri kirib:  

“Hammomni tez bo’shatinglar, podshohning bosh folbinining xotini yuvinishga kelayaptilar”, deb hammani chala yuvingan holda chiqarib yuboribdi. Bu hol kampirgajuda alam qilibdi. Uyga kelib, choliga bo’lgan voqeani aytibdi va:   

“To podshohning bosh folbini bo’lmaguningizcha men siz bilan yashamayman”, deb cholni urishibdi. Chol o’ylab-o’ylab tavakkal qilibdi: Bir siqim toshchalami olib, bozorning ko’zga ko’rinarli bir joyini egallab, fol boqmoqchidek o’tiraveribdi. Cholning yoniga ust-boshi chang bir odam kelib:   

“Ota men safardan kelayapman. Biz podshohga oltin va kumush ortilgan tuyalar olib kelayotgan edik, shu tuyalardan biri yo’qolib qoldi. Shuni fol boqib, qayerda yurganini bilib bersangiz”, - debdi. Chol u kishidan qaysi yo’ldan, qanday holda kelganini obdon surushtirib, mulohaza qilib ko’ribdi-da:  

“Oxirgi marta dam olgan manzillaringiz yaqinidagi jarlikda yo’qotgan tuyangiz o’tlab yuribdi, ustida tilla va kumush ortilgan xuijuni ham bor”,-debdi. Chunki u kishining gaplaridan shunday xulosa chiqayotgan ekan-da. Fol boqtirgan odam cholning aytgan joyiga borib qarasa, rostdan ham tuyasi o’tlab yurgan emish.  

U cholga bir hovuch oltin sovg’a qilib, yurgan yo’lida cholning o’ta topag’on folbin ekanligini aytib, uning dovrug’ini orttiraveribdi. Shu orada podshohning xazinasini o’g’ri urib ketibdi. Podshoh saroyidagi folbinlaming birortasi ham xazinani topa olishmabdi. Shunda podshoh chol haqida eshitib qolibdi va uni saroyga chaqirtirib kelibdi. Chol voqeani eshitgach:  

“Podshohim, menga qirq kun muhlat bilan qirqta xo’roz berasiz”, -debdi. Podshoh cholning aytganlarini muhayyo qilibdi. Chol xo’rozlami bir xizmatkorga ko’tartirib, uyiga olib kelibdi va kampirga:  

“Sen obro’parast kampir qariganda meni sarson qilding. Mana, podshoh menga shunday mushkul ish topshirdi. Endi baribir men xazinani topa olmayman. Shuning uchun o’limim oldidan bir maishat qilib qolay. Har kuni sen menga bitta xo’rozni so’yib, palov damlab ber. Qirq kundan keyin bir gap bo’lar”, - debdi. Kampir kechqurunga palov damlab, cholning oldiga olib kiribdi. Tillani shahardagi qirq qaroqchi o’g’irlagan ekan. Ular xazinani topish dong’i ketgan cholga topshirilganini eshitib xavfsirashibdi. O’g’riboshi:  

“Qani, chol qanday qilib bizlami toparkin, bor bilib kel”, -deb bir o’g’rini cholning uyiga yuboribdi. O’g’ri chol o’tirgan uyning tomidagi mo’ridan har bir gap-so’zni eshitib o’tiribdi. Shu payt xonaga kampir xo’roz bosilgan palovni ko’tarib kiribdi. Chol yengini shimarib, palovga qo’l uzatib:   

“Yo bismillo, qirqta edi, bittasi keldi, o’ttiz to’qqiztasi qoldi”, -debdi. Bu gapni eshitgan o’g’rining esi chiqib ketibdi. “Ha, chol bizlarni bilarkan”, deb o’ylab chopganicha o’g’riboshiga borib:  

“Chol bizning qirqta o’g’ri ekanligimizni, bugun men borganimni-yu, yana o’ttiz to’qqiz kishi qolganini ham bildi”, - debdi. O’g’riboshi bu gapga ishonmabdi. Ertasi kuni o’sha o’g’riga yana bir o’g’rini qo’shib yuboribdi. Ikkala o’g’ri mo’ridan quloq solib o’tirishsa, chol:  

“Qirqta edi, ikkitasi keldi, o’ttiz sakkiztasi qoldi”, - debdi. Ikkala o’g’ri hovliqib o’g’riboshiga borishibdi va cholning gaplarini aytishibdi. O’g’riboshi bu gapga ham ishonmay, uchinchi kuni o’zi borib, mo’ridan poylabdi. Shunda kampir kattakon, lekin bir oyog’i yo’q xo’rozni palovning tepasiga bosib kelibdi. Buni ko’rgan chol:  

“Eh-eh, bugun rosa kattasi keldi-yu, bir oyog’ i cho’ loq ekan-da”, -debdi. O’g’riboshining ham bir oyog’i cho’loq ekan. O’g’riboshi,
“Ha, bu chol hamma narsani bilarkan“, deb o’ylabdi. O ’g’rilar bilan maslahatlashib, cholning oldiga o’zi boribdi va: 

“Ota, siz shunchalik to’g’ri fol boqarkansiz, men o’zim keldim, podshohning jazosidan saqlab qoling, aytganingizni qilamiz”, -debdi. Chol bular xazina o’g’rilari ekanligini bilibdi-da:  

“Xazinaning bir tillasini ham kamaytirmay, eski qabristonga olib kelib, falon yerdagi go’rga ko’mib qo’yinglar”, -debdi. O’g’rilar cholga ko’pdan-ko’p minnatdorchilik bildirib, aytganini qilishibdi. Chol qirq kun xo’rozli palovni yeb, qirq birinchi kuni podshoh saroyiga boribdi va:  

“Podshohim, eski qabristondagi falon go’rda xazinangizning bitta tillasi ham kamaymay turibdi, borib olib keling”, - debdi. Podshoh odamlarini yuborsa, haqiqatan xazina bus-butun turgan emish. Xazina topilgach, podshoh cholni saroyning bosh folbini etib tayinlabdi. Endi kampir ham fayton aravalarda hammomga borib, yayrab yuvinadigan bo’libdi. Bir kuni podshoh mulozimlari va folbinlari bilan bog’ aylanishga chiqibdi. Aylanib yurib, folbin cholni chaqiribdi va:  

“Kaftimda nima borligini toping. Topsangiz yeb yotishga yetadigan mol-dunyo berib, umringizning oxirigacha sizni ta’minlayman. Topolmasangiz kallangizni oldiraman”, - debdi. Cholning oyoq-qo’lidan mador ketib:  

“Xah, yaramas kampir-a, aytgandim, endi folbinlikni yig’ishtiray, yiqqan-terganimizni yeb yotaylik deb, nafsing qurg’ur ko’nmadi. Mana endi nima bo’ldi?” deb o’ylabdi.

“Bir sakradim-qutuldim, ikki sakradim-qutuldim, uchinchisida-tutildim”, - debdi afsuslanib. Cholning bu gapini eshitgan podshoh xaxolab kulib, kaftini ochibdi. Kaftida chigirtka bor ekan.   “Qoyilman, topqirligingizga”, - debdi podshoh. “O’zim ham uchinchi sakraganda tutgan edim.” Bu gapni eshitgan chol o’zining qanday qilib folbin bo’lib qolganini aytib beribdi va podshohdan folbinlikni tashlab, tinch yashashga ruxsat so’rabdi.   

Podshoh ham kula-kula o’z so’zining ustidan chiqish uchun cholga to umrining oxirgacha yotib yeydigan nafaqa tayinlab, ketishiga ruxsat bergan ekan. Shunday qilib, chol bilan kampir murod-maqsadlariga yetishibdi, umrlarining oxirigacha farovon yashashibdi.

## Text in English

**Forced to be a soothsayer**   

Once upon a time, there lived an old man and old woman. They could barely make ends meet living in poverty. One day the old woman went to the city bathhouse. Before she could wash her hair that had been masked with sour milk, one of the servants came in and dragged everyone out, saying that the wife of the Chief Royal soothsayer was coming. This dismayed the woman and she told her husband everything that had happened in the bath house, and she insisted, saying: “If you can’t become the King’s soothsayer, I shan’t live with you anymore, trust me, I won’t!” . After thinking it over the old man decided to take a chance and, taking a handful of pebbles, occupied a conspicuous part of the market as if to tell fortunes. 

One man dressed in dirty and dusty clothes came up to him and said: “We were traveling and bringing camels laden with silver and gold, but one of them got lost. Can you tell me where we can find that camel?” The old man asked in detail where and how those camels had been brought. After contemplating, he said: “There’s a cliff not far from where you where you last stayed, that’s where you can find your camel with a sack filled with silver and gold.” From what the man was saying he was able to infer where the camel was. 
When that man went to the ravine, he saw his camel there. The stranger gave the old man a handful of gold as a gift and told everybody about how quick-witted a soothsayer he was. This made him famous. 

At that time, the royal treasure was said to have been stolen by someone, but no one could find the thief. Upon hearing about the old man who had found the camel, the King summoned him to the palace. After hearing everything, the old man said: “Your highness, would you please give me forty days and forty roosters”. Everything he asked for was given to him in the blink of an eye. Then he went home, taking all the roosters with the help of a maid. He said to his wife: 
“You are status-obsessed and have gotten me in trouble, now the King has given me an impossible task. There’s no way I’ll be able to find the treasure. So, I’m going to enjoy my life one last time before I die. Every day you will slaughter one of the roosters and prepare it with rice, come what may in forty days.” The old woman prepared the rice and meat that evening and brought it to him. 

In fact, the royal treasure had been stolen by forty bandits. They became frightened when they heard that the task of finding the royal treasure had been assigned to the famous soothsayer. Thus, the chief bandit sent one of his thieves to the house of the soothsayer, saying: “How is the old man supposed to find us? Go and find out.” The thief went to the old man’s house and eavesdropped on the roof through the chimney. The old woman brought the pilaf in and the old man rolled his sleeves up and said: 

“Oh, thank God, there were forty of them, now there are thirty nine left” referring to the roosters. Having heard this, the thief became frightened. He thought that the old man was referring to them. He ran to the head thief, and said:

“The old man knew that there were forty of us, that I had come to his house today, and that there were thirty nine of us left.” The head thief could not believe it. The following day he sent one more thief with him. Listening through the chimney, the two thieves heard the old man say: 
“Look, there were forty, two have come, and there are thirty eight left.” Both of the thieves hurried back to the head thief and told him what the old man had said. The chief thief again did not believe it, and the next day he decided to go there himself. While he was eavesdropping on their roof, the old woman brought in the rice alongside a rooster with a missing leg. The old man saw this and said:

“Well, today a really big one has come, but one of its legs is lame.” Indeed, one of the head chief’s legs was also lame. 
The head thief was thus convinced that the old man did indeed know everything. After conferring with the other thieves, he went to the old man and said: 
“Sir, you truly see everything. I have come to ask you to spare us from the king’s punishment. In exchange, we will do whatever you say.”  The old man understood that they were the thieves who robbed the treasure, and said:

“Without taking a single gold piece, take the treasure to the old cemetery and bury it in a grave there.” The thieves thanked the old man profusely and did what he said. After eating forty days’ worth of rooster meat and rice, on the forty first day, the old man went to the king’s palace and said: 
“My king, your treasure is buried in a grave in the cemetery without a single gold piece missing. Go and get it.” The king sent his men to retrieve it. They found it without anything missing. After the treasure was found, the King appointed the old man as his chief soothsayer. Now his wife could go to the bathhouse in a carriage and happily bathe. 

One day, the King went out to the garden for a walk with his servants and soothsayers and called the old man and said: 
“Guess what’s in my hand. If you guess correctly, I will give you enough wealth to sustain you for the rest of your life, but if you don’t, I will have you beheaded” The man became weak with fear, and said:

“Alas, that evil wife, I said I should quit soothsaying, I said that we should live off of what we have, but she was too greedy to agree. Now what will happen?” 
He then said with regret: “I jumped to safety twice, but the third time I have been caught.” Having heard this, the king laughed, and opened his fist. In his palm was a grasshopper. The king said: “I am amazed at your cunning, “You’re right, I only caught it on the third jump.” Having heard this, the old man told the king how he had become a soothsayer. He asked permission to leave his post and live peacefully. 

The king burst out laughing, and then, keeping his promise, he gave the old man a pension generous enough to sustain him for the rest of his life, and allowed him to leave. Thus, the old man and woman received all they desired, and lived plentifully till the end of their days.
